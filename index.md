# "Thoughts on Chapter 7, *The Pragmatic Programmer*"
March 22, 2019

While reading *The Pragmatic Programmer*, Chapter 7, I paused at the first sentence because yes, that is exactly how I feel in life. Though, what they said is exactly what I tend to do with projects: procrastinate. But starting too soon? That's a problem? Yeah, if you code before you know what you're coding, then yeah, that's a problem. They should have worded that differently. I never thought to use a project glossary before, but I like the idea. Especially, when talking with clients becuase they are touchy about those sort of things.


# "Thoughts on Chapter 2, *The Pragmatic Programmer*"

  While reading *The Pragmatic Programmer*, Chapter 2, I realized that I don't fully understand the concept of metadata, and how it is different from just data. While I already understood the idea that we shouldn't replicate code, I was interested in the notion that sometimes you have to duplicate code in a program. I was also intrigued by Orthogonality as it relates to teams that work together. I understand how coding and orthonagals interact, as you add new code you have to make sure it doens't affect the other code you've already written more than what you need to save yourself from having problems. I was interested though in the example with teams. It was a great way to fully understand what the authors were talking about in regards to coding.

  Reading *The Pragmatic Programmer*, Chapter 1, reminded me a lot of the advice I was given in the business classes freshmen year before I realized I wanted to go into Computer Science. I have to say, I agreed withh it then, and I agree with it now. I appreciated that the authors of the book included advice on when to talk to your boss and how to phrase things like they did in Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs section. The fact they included information like that was actually the only surprising thing in the chapter. 
  

# "Why I am Taking Software Engineering"

  I'm taking Software Engineering because I love to code. I want to learn about the process that people in the industry go through, and I want to figure out the most efficient and effective way to get through the coding process. 


# "What Software Engineering Means to Me"

  Software Engineering is the development and maintenance of software. Other than that, it doesn't mean much to me.
